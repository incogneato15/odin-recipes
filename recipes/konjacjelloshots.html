                <p>Konjac jello shots are a great way to turn any get together into a party! They're perfect for any celebration taste fantastic, and are sure to get anyone nice and loose. Unlike regular jello shots which are made with gelatin, konjac jelly is suitable for vegans too! The best thing about konjac jelly is that they're so simple, cheap and easy to customize. You can change your spirit of choice, flavoring, and solvent to create endless combinations. You might chose to use flavoring powders like Crystal Light and Kool-Aid, liquids like Mio and flavor drops, or other things like your favorite liqueur, home made jams, blended frozen fruits, or whatever your mind can come up with. You can also experiment with replacing regular water with coconut water to add electrolytes, erithritrol to replace the calories in sugar while maintaing the sweetness, or pre-workout for a nice caffeinated feeling.</p>
                <p>Konjac jelly is made from a powder called Konjac powder and water and usually some type of flavoring. You can buy konjac powder at your local Asian grocery store, certain boutique grocery stores, or online at places like Amazon. When making konjac jelly, you'll want to add your flavoring and alcohol to warm or hot water first and then quickly whisk the powder to prevent clumps and lumps from setting. If you're ready to be the MVP at your next party, check out the recipe below.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                	<li>One packet of konjac powder</li>
                	<li>Flavoring of your choice</li>
                	<li>Vodka or spirit of your choice</li>
                	<li>One litre of water</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                	<li>Put a litre of water on the stove and begin adding your flavoring. Aim to make your flavoring a bit stronger than you'd like in order to mask the taste of vodka or other spirit</li>
                	<li>Once you've achieved the right amount of flavor, take the pot off of the stove to prevent the spirit from evaporating and add your spirit. Eyeball the amount. You can make it as strong or as weak as you desire.</li>
                	<li>While the water is still hot, add konjac powder to the water whisking quickly to prevent clumps.</li>
                	<li>Once fully disolved, pour the solution into cups or a brownie pan, caserole dish, or other container and let set for three or more hours in the refrigerator. If you used a brownie pan or similar dish to cool the jelly, slice pieces into manageable chunks.</li>
                </ol>
