        <h1>Negroni</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A negroni is a classic cocktail. With three simple ingredients, this drink balances bitter, sweet, citrusy, and botanical flavors to create a lovely drink that's been enjoyed by many for decades. The original cocktail calls for Campari, Sweet Vermouth, and Gin stirred to chill and served in a double rocks glass over ice taking an orange twist to garnish. Since its original creation, many variations have emerged that build on this beautiful cocktail, but before we get into that, let's focus on the OG shall we? I'm sure we've all heard of gin, the one liquor that you don't want to shoot... ever. There are two variations of gin, London Dry Gin, and American Dry Gin. You can generally expect the same juniper-forward profile to London Dry Gins while American Dry Gins offer those same botanicals and more experimenting with additions of lavendar, Douglas fir, and more! Either works well for this drink and some of my favorites are St. George Terroir Gin, Tanqueray, and Junipero Gin, a small company local to the San Francisco Bay Area. Not everyone knows about these next two liqueurs: Campari and Sweet Vermouth. Born in Italy, Campari is a bitter somewhat peppery with notes of citrus rind. The bitterness of Campari helps ground the wild botanical notes of gin and keep the sweetness of our next ingredient in check too. Sweet Vermouth is one of the most versatile spirits and chances are you've probably came across it if you've ever taken a trip to a cocktail bar. Sweet Vermouth is a fortified wine spirit with a syrupy texture and a nice dose of sweetness, not like quite like sugar, more like if red wine mixed with molasses. My recommended Vermouths are Carpano Antica and if that's not around, Cinzano or Martini &amp; Rossi work fine too. Vermouth must be refrigerated after opening but there are plenty of cocktails to get it off of your hands such as the Manhattan, Americano, or the Bronx </p>
        <p>The Negroni has many close cousins including the Boulevardier (swap gin for whiskey and serve up in a coup), the Sbagliato (swap gin for champagne and serve in a wine glass with ice cubes), the Americano (ommit gin and top with soda water). There's also bartenders who've experimented with swappin the liqueurs for alternatives such as using Aperol in place of Campari for less bitterness in the profile, or the White Negroni that maintains the simple three-ingredient formula but uses dry vermouth (or similar alternatives like Lillet Blanc or Cocchi Americano) in place of sweet vermouth, and Amari, a class of Italian liqueurs close to Campari that bring a lighter sweeter finish. Personally, I like my negroni served chilled without ice because your tongue can pick up on this drink's sweeter flavors when it's not too cold. I think you get the point though. A Negroni is like the sweet grouchy grandpa that a lot of people adore but a lot of people really hate; either way he shaped this family into what it is today and we've got a lot to thank him for.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        	<li>Stir with a spoon in a controlled manner until the glass becomes cold.</li>
        	<li>Strain the drink into a double rocks glass over a large ice cube if possible. If not, your largest piece of ice will suffice.</li>
