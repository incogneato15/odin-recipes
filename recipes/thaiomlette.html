        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Thai omlette for many Americans is a dish that's familiar yet unique. When most of us think of omlettes, we usually think of going out to a diner on sunday morning with the rich smells of fried potatoes, sweet pancakes topped with fruit and whipped cream, mugs of coffee served alongside tiny packages of cream and sugar and most importantly, good company. Most people are familiar with the difficult process of making a traditional American omlette; the burst of cooking spray the delicate handling of the eggs to ensure a perfect disc, and perfectly timing the melty cheese topping without burning your omlette.</p>

        <p>A Thai omlette is not too dissimilar to an American omlette. However, you'll find that it's much easier to get that perfect shape rather than yeilding to the whims of the mighty egg and settling for a scramble. Unlike American omlettes, Thai omlettes are panfried and meant to be served with slight browning. This produces a puffier and more airy texture compared to the spongier American omlette. Thai omlettes are usually served with white rice as a starch rather than hashbrowns or country potatoes. There are many different fillings that can go into a Thai omlette, but this recipe will focus on the most basic way to enjoy this wonderful dish. Want to see how they're made?

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
        	<li>Two whole eggs</li>
        	<li>Half tsp soy sauce</li>
        	<li>Half tsp fish sauce</li>
        	<li>One green onion</li>
        	<li>Enough vegetable oil to coat a small or medium sized skillet by a quarter inch or one centimeter</li>
        	<li>Optional: sriracha</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        	<li>Heat your vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-low heat</li>
        	<li>While your skillet is heating, in a small bowl, whisk together your eggs, soy and fish sauce, and most of your green onion sliced into small disks.</li>
        	<li>Using the remaining egg on the wisk, allow a drop of your egg mixture to fall into the skillet to see if it has reached the proper temperature. You should see the egg puff up into a bloom. If it does not you may need to let the oil heat up further or adjust the heat to a higher temperature.</li>
        	<li>Once the oil is hot enough, pour the beatten egg into the oil. After it forms a substantial patty, it is ready to be served.</li>
        	<li>Place your omlette on a plate and top with the remaining green onion. Add a drizzle of sriracha if you enjoy a spicier dish and eat with white rice for a filling breakfast!</li>
        </ol>
