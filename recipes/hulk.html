        <h1>The Incredible Hulk</h1>
        <img src="" alt="Hulk">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Incredible Hulk is a largely forgotten club drink that reached popularity in the early 2000s. The drink gets its namesake from its green color and keen ability to knock you on your @**! The drink consists of two ingredients, Hennesy, and a liqueur that has fallen out of popularity called Hpnotiq. Hypnotiq, pronounced as "hypnotic" is known for it's incredibly bright blue color and sweet fruity taste and relatively high alcohol content at 17% ABV. After its initial release, it was referenced and promoted by many hip hop and rap artists of the time including Missy Elliot, Fabulous and Sean Combs aka P. Diddy. The Incredible Hulk cocktail was introduced by one of the bartenders at Sean Combs' restaurant, Justin's New York, who noticed that men were offput by the bright blue color of Hypnotiq and it's sweet flavor and decided to mix it with Hennesy. Fragile masculinity asside, the drink became a hit and both men and women were enjoying Hypnotiq all night! When the Hypnotiq is combined with Hennesy, it creates an unnatural green hue and a sweet, yet agressive profile that helps you remember, or rather forget, that this drink comes with a punch. It's a very unique drink that I was surprised to enjoy and I'm not sure I've had anything that comes close to it.</p>
        <p>The standard ratio is generally 1:1 equal parts Hypnotiq and Hennesy, but for a brighter green color and sweeter taste, a 2:1 mix of Hypnotiq to Hennessy is also suitable. This is one of my father's favorite drinks and I hope that you'll like it too! Beware, there's a reason this drink is called the Hulk!</p>
